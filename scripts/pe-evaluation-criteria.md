- API specifications and OpenAPI schemas
- Architecture diagrams and technical blogs
- Security audit reports and certifications
- Performance benchmarks and case studies

### Medium-Value Evidence (0.7-0.9 confidence)
- Technology detection from page analysis
- Team information from About/Career pages
- Customer testimonials and case studies
- Pricing and business model indicators
- Integration partner listings

### Supporting Evidence (0.5-0.7 confidence)
- News articles and press releases
- Social media mentions
- Job postings indicating growth
- Conference presentations
- GitHub/open source activity

## Red Flags for Investment

1. **Technical Debt Indicators**
   - Legacy frameworks (jQuery, old Angular)
   - Monolithic architecture
   - No API documentation
   - Poor test coverage signals

2. **Scalability Concerns**
   - Single-region deployment only
   - No mention of auto-scaling
   - Shared hosting indicators
   - Performance complaints in reviews

3. **Security Gaps**
   - No security certifications mentioned
   - Missing security headers
   - Outdated SSL/TLS versions
   - No bug bounty program

4. **Team Risks**
   - High engineering turnover
   - Outsourced core development
   - No technical leadership visibility
   - Lack of innovation indicators

## Minimum Evidence Thresholds

For a billion-dollar investment decision:

- **Total Evidence Items**: 200+ (comprehensive view)
- **High-Confidence Items**: 50+ (strong signals)
- **Code Analysis Pages**: 10+ (technical depth)
- **Security Assessments**: 5+ (risk mitigation)
- **API Documentation**: Present (integration potential)
- **Customer Evidence**: 10+ (market validation)

## Investment Decision Matrix

| Evidence Quality | Technical Score | Business Score | Recommendation |
|-----------------|-----------------|----------------|----------------|
| Excellent (200+) | 80%+ | 70%+ | Strong Buy - Proceed to financial DD |
| Good (150-200) | 70%+ | 60%+ | Conditional - Address specific gaps |
| Fair (100-150) | 60%+ | 50%+ | Risky - Significant concerns |
| Poor (<100) | <60% | <50% | Pass - Insufficient evidence |

## Key Questions to Answer
