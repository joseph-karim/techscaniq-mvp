TechScan IQ – SaaS Technical Due Diligence Platform

PROJECT OVERVIEW:
TechScan IQ is a SaaS platform designed to streamline and democratize technical due diligence for early-stage investors. By combining an AI-driven analysis engine with a structured human-in-the-loop review, the platform turns complex assessments of startups' technology stacks, architecture, security, and code quality into clear, actionable intelligence.

KEY PROBLEMS SOLVED:
1. Speed – Traditional technical reviews are too slow for fast-moving deals
2. Cost – Smaller investors often can't afford full-service engineering audits  
3. Relevance – Generic reports rarely map to an investor's unique thesis
4. Clarity – Non-engineering stakeholders struggle to interpret highly technical findings
