Product Requirements Document: TechScanIQ Production Enhancement

Project Name: TechScanIQ - Enterprise Investment Intelligence Platform
Version: 2.0
Date: May 2024

Executive Summary:
TechScanIQ requires comprehensive enhancements to evolve from a technical demo to a production-ready investment intelligence platform. The current system demonstrates basic capabilities but lacks the depth, reliability, and integration quality needed for institutional investors. This PRD outlines the complete overhaul needed across data collection, AI analysis, system architecture, and user experience.

Problem Statement:
Current critical limitations preventing production readiness:
1. Evidence Collection Gaps:
   - Collects only basic technical data (HTML, security scans, performance metrics)
   - No financial data collection (funding, revenue, growth metrics)
   - No team/personnel information extraction
   - Limited market intelligence and competitor analysis
   - High failure rates with external API integrations
   - Timeouts and worker creation failures in edge functions

2. AI Analysis Quality Issues:
   - Generic placeholder text instead of detailed analysis
   - No extraction of specific names, metrics, or technologies
   - Inconsistent citation generation and evidence linking
   - API quota exhaustion with free tier models
   - Poor error handling for AI service failures

3. System Architecture Problems:
   - Frontend-backend data structure mismatches
   - Database schema inconsistencies (missing columns, constraint violations)
   - Edge function memory issues (exit code 137)
   - JWT verification failures and CORS issues
   - Schema cache synchronization problems

4. User Experience Limitations:
   - Reports lack investment-grade depth and specificity
   - Mock data quality far exceeds actual generated reports
   - Missing real-time status updates during processing
   - No progressive loading or partial results display
   - Limited customization options for report generation

Goals and Objectives:
1. Build comprehensive evidence collection pipeline with 20+ data sources
