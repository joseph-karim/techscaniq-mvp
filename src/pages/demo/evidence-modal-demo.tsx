  reasoning: `The evidence clearly demonstrates multiple security vulnerabilities in the authentication system:

1. **Hardcoded Credentials**: The codebase contains hardcoded API keys and secrets directly in configuration files, which is a critical security anti-pattern. These credentials are visible to anyone with repository access and cannot be easily rotated.

2. **Lack of Session Management**: The documentation explicitly states that session management is not implemented, meaning user sessions persist indefinitely without proper timeout mechanisms.

3. **Manual Key Rotation**: The engineering team confirmed that API key rotation is a manual process, indicating poor security hygiene and operational overhead.

4. **No Modern Authentication**: The absence of OAuth, JWT, or other modern authentication mechanisms suggests the system is vulnerable to various attack vectors including token theft and replay attacks.

These findings collectively indicate a significant security debt that could expose the application to unauthorized access and data breaches.`,
