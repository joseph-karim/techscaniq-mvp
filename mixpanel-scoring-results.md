- **Overall Confidence**: (0.74 × 0.6) + (0.595 × 0.4) = 68%

### Penalties Applied
- **Missing Critical Evidence**: 
  - test_coverage
  - unit_economics 
  - customer_churn
  - technical_architecture
  - customer_references
- **Penalty**: 5 items × 10% = 50% (max penalty)

### Final Score Calculation
- Base Score: 76/100
- Confidence Multiplier: 0.5 + (0.68 × 0.5) = 0.84

## Key Findings

### Strengths
- Good evidence coverage across all dimensions (119 items)
- Reasonable confidence levels (68-74%)
- Strong technical evidence base (25 items)

### Gaps Identified
1. **Missing Critical Evidence**:
   - No test coverage metrics
   - No unit economics data
   - No customer churn information
   - Limited technical architecture details
   - No customer reference data

2. **Evidence Coverage**: Only 59.5% of expected 200 items

3. **Low Final Score** due to:
   - 50% penalty for missing critical evidence
   - Below-target evidence quantity
   - Investment thesis alignment concerns

## Recommendations

1. **Collect Missing Critical Evidence**:
   - Obtain technical architecture documentation
   - Gather unit economics and financial metrics
   - Get customer references and churn data
   - Access test coverage reports

2. **Increase Evidence Depth**:
   - Target 200+ evidence items for comprehensive coverage
   - Focus on quantitative metrics
   - Add primary source documents

3. **Improve Confidence Levels**:
   - Verify evidence with multiple sources
   - Add more recent data (< 6 months)
   - Include official company documents

The low score (32/100) is primarily driven by the 50% penalty for missing critical evidence. With complete evidence collection, the base score of 76/100 would result in a much higher final score, potentially moving from "Pass" to "Buy" recommendation.
