# TechScanIQ Enhancement Summary & Next Steps

## What We've Accomplished

### 1. **Root Cause Analysis**
We identified why reports were generic:
- Information overload (130+ sources)
- No citation enforcement
- Single massive prompt trying to do everything
- No acknowledgment of data gaps

### 2. **Architectural Improvements**
Created a staged report generation system:
- **Section-by-section generation** with focused prompts
- **Evidence-based citations** required for every claim
- **Data gap acknowledgment** built into each section
- **Master editor review** for consistency
- **Confidence scoring** per section

### 3. **Immediate Fixes Applied**
- Fixed TypeError with undefined titles
- Enhanced error handling for plain text responses
- Added structured fallbacks when analysis fails

## To Test Right Now

Run this command to see the improved system:
```bash
node test-staged-pipeline.js "Snowplow" "https://snowplow.io" "buy-and-scale"
```

## What You'll See

### Old Output:
```
"I apologize, but I cannot provide a comprehensive technical analysis 
of Snowplow's technology stack based on the limited evidence provided. 
The single evidence item only mentions that Snowplow has technology 
partners and integrations..."
```

### New Output Structure:
```
Technology Assessment
- Overview: "Based on 15 evidence chunks, identified React frontend [3,7]..."
- Identified Stack: Frontend: ["React [3,7]"], Backend: ["Not found"]
- Data Gaps: ["Backend language not in evidence", "Database unknown"]
- Confidence: 65%

Market Position
- Overview: "Market analysis from 8 sources shows data analytics focus [2,5]..."
- Competitors: ["Segment mentioned as alternative [4]", "Google Analytics [6]"]
- Data Gaps: ["No TAM data found", "Market share unknown"]
- Confidence: 45%
```

## This Week's Critical Tasks

### 1. **Implement Query Decomposition** (2 days)
Instead of one broad search, break into focused queries:
```javascript
// In evidence-collection-worker.ts
const queries = [
  `${company} technology stack architecture`,
  `${company} scalability performance metrics`,
  `${company} API documentation developer`,
  `${company} customer reviews G2 Capterra`,
  // ... 15-20 specific queries per thesis
];
```

### 2. **Set Up Vector Database** (1 day)
```javascript
// Choose one:
- Pinecone (easiest setup, good free tier)
- Weaviate (self-hosted option)
- Qdrant (good performance)

// Embed evidence chunks and rank by relevance
```

### 3. **Update Evidence Collection Worker** (1 day)
- Implement the enhanced evidence collector from `IMMEDIATE_PROMPT_IMPROVEMENTS.md`
- Add source credibility scoring
- Limit to top 25 most relevant chunks per section

### 4. **Deploy Staged Generator** (1 day)
- Replace current worker with staged version
- Update queue names if needed
- Test with 5-10 real companies

## Expected Results

After implementing these changes:

### Quality Improvements:
- ✅ Specific, evidence-backed claims
- ✅ Clear data gap acknowledgment  
- ✅ Accurate citations for verification
- ✅ Confidence scores reflecting reality

### Metrics to Track:
- Citation coverage: >90% of claims
- Confidence scores: 60-80% for good data
- Data gaps: 3-5 per section (not 0!)
- User satisfaction: Significant increase

## Investment for Full Implementation

### Week 1-2: Core Improvements
- Query decomposition
- Vector database setup
- Evidence ranking pipeline

### Week 3-4: Advanced Features
- Source credibility weighting
- Cross-section insights
- Citation verification

### Month 2: Optimization
- Performance tuning
- Cost optimization
- UI enhancements

## The Bottom Line

We've transformed the architecture from:
> "Dump everything into one prompt and hope"

To:
> "Focused analysis of relevant evidence with clear traceability"

This is the difference between a $10/month web summarizer and a $10,000/month PE-grade analysis tool.

## Ready to Start?

1. Test the staged pipeline with a few companies
2. Compare output quality to current system
3. Implement query decomposition
4. Roll out gradually with monitoring

The foundation is now solid. Each improvement builds on this architecture to create truly valuable investment intelligence.
