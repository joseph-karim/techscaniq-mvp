    content: `CIBC's digital transformation strategy is driven by several critical business imperatives:

1. **Competitive Pressure**: Canadian banking sector experiencing unprecedented digital disruption from fintechs and digital-first competitors. CIBC must accelerate innovation to maintain market position.

2. **Customer Expectations**: Modern banking customers demand seamless, personalized experiences across all channels. Current capabilities lag behind expectations, creating friction and attrition risk.

4. **Operational Efficiency**: Legacy systems and fragmented data create inefficiencies. Unified platform approach can reduce operational costs by 30-40%.

5. **Regulatory Compliance**: Evolving privacy regulations (PIPEDA, Open Banking) require sophisticated consent management and data governance capabilities.

Strategic Initiatives Requiring Adobe Solutions:
• Personal Banking Transformation: Reimagining retail banking experience
• Wealth Management Digitization: Creating sophisticated investor journeys
• Commercial Banking Platform: B2B experience modernization
• Data & Analytics Excellence: Building unified customer intelligence

These initiatives represent immediate opportunities for Adobe Experience Cloud implementation, with executive sponsorship and dedicated budgets already in place.`,
