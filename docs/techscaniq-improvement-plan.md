# TechScanIQ MVP - Improvement Plan

## Executive Summary

Through the process of implementing mock data and analyzing the current system, we've identified significant gaps in the data pipeline and report generation quality. The core issues stem from:

1. **Limited Evidence Collection**: Current tools collect only basic technical data
2. **Generic AI Prompts**: Prompts request placeholder text rather than detailed analysis
3. **Frontend-Backend Integration**: Misalignment between expected and actual data structures
4. **Report Quality**: Generated reports lack the depth required for investment decisions

## Current State Analysis

### 1. Evidence Collection Pipeline (evidence-collector-v7)

**Current Tools:**
- **html-collector**: Basic HTML content extraction
- **google-search-collector**: Simple business information queries
- **playwright-crawler**: Technical analysis (scripts, APIs)
- **wappalyzer**: Technology stack detection
- **security-scanner**: Basic security checks
- **ssl-analyzer**: SSL certificate analysis
- **performance-analyzer**: Basic performance metrics
- **nuclei-scanner**: Vulnerability scanning (comprehensive depth only)

**Key Limitations:**
- No financial data collection (funding, revenue, growth metrics)
- No team/personnel information extraction
- Limited market analysis capabilities
- No competitor analysis
- No patent or intellectual property search
- No news/press release monitoring
- No social media sentiment analysis
- No job posting analysis for growth indicators

### 2. AI Analysis Quality (tech-intelligence-v3)

**Current Issues:**
- Prompts were asking for generic placeholder text
- No specific extraction instructions for:
  - Named individuals and their backgrounds
  - Specific financial metrics and calculations
  - Actual competitor names and analysis
  - Real technology versions and configurations
  - Concrete market size data with sources

**Recent Improvements:**
- Updated prompts to require 3-5 paragraphs per section
- Added requirements for confidence scores
- Instructed to extract specific names, metrics, and data
- Required evidence citations [1], [2] format
- Emphasized professional investment committee tone

### 3. Frontend-Backend Integration Issues

**Data Structure Mismatches:**
- Frontend expects comprehensive report structure
- Backend returns different field names and nested structures
- Missing fields in backend responses:
  - `stackEvolution` timeline data
  - `codeAnalysis` repository information
  - `aiCapabilities` assessment
  - `competitiveAnalysis` with actual competitors
  - `financialIndicators` with calculated metrics

**Report Type Confusion:**
- Multiple report generation endpoints (v2, v3, executive)
- Inconsistent data formats between versions
- Frontend designed for richer data than backend provides
