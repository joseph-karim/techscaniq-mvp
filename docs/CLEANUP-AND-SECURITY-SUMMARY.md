# Legacy Code Cleanup and Security Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the legacy code cleanup and security basics implementation completed as part of DEV-002.

## Legacy Code Cleanup

### Workers Removed
1. **report-generation-worker-v2.ts** - Old version superseded by LangGraph v4
2. **report-generation-worker-v3.ts** - Intermediate version no longer needed
3. **evidence-collection-worker-jina.ts** - Replaced by crawl4ai worker

### Package.json Scripts Updated
- Removed legacy scripts: `worker:evidence`, `worker:report`, `worker:report:v2`
- Added modern scripts:
  - `worker:evidence:active` - Uses crawl4ai worker
  - `worker:report:active` - Uses LangGraph v4 with backend
  - `workers:modern` - Runs both modern workers
  - `dev:modern` - Full stack with backend
  - `start:all` - Uses start-with-backend.sh script

### Modern Architecture Preserved
- LangGraph v4 worker with backend integration
- Python FastAPI backend with MCP/Serena tools
- MCP integration for enhanced analysis
- Redis-based job queuing
- Supabase for data persistence

## Security Implementation

### 1. Rate Limiting
#### API Server (Node.js/Express)
- 100 requests per 15-minute window per IP
- Configurable limits
- Automatic cleanup of expired entries
- Health check endpoints excluded

#### Python Backend (FastAPI)
- 10 requests per 60-second window per IP
- Middleware-based implementation
- Configurable limits
- Health/metrics endpoints excluded

### 2. Input Validation

#### URL Validation
- Must be HTTP or HTTPS protocol
- Blocks file://, javascript:, ftp:// etc.
- Blocks localhost and private IPs in production
- Allows localhost in development

#### Code Input Validation
- Validates code is proper object format
- Enforces size limits (default 100KB)
- Prevents memory exhaustion attacks

#### String Sanitization
- Removes HTML tags (<, >)
- Removes quotes (', ")
- Trims whitespace
- Applied to user-provided strings

### 3. Security Headers

#### API Server
- X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
- X-Frame-Options: DENY
- X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
- Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin

#### Python Backend
- Same headers as API server
- Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS) in production
- Additional security middleware

### 4. CORS Configuration

#### API Server
- Whitelisted origins only
- Supports credentials
- Limited to GET and POST methods
- Specific allowed headers

#### Python Backend
- Synchronized with frontend origins
- Production URL from environment
- Trusted host middleware in production

### 5. Environment Security

#### Environment Validation
- Required variables checked on startup
- Production fails on missing required vars
- Development shows warnings
- Clear error messages

#### .env.example Updated
- Complete variable documentation
- Security warnings included
- Separate frontend/backend sections
- No actual values committed

### 6. Additional Security Measures

#### Request Size Limits
- API server: 1MB body limit
- Prevents DoS via large payloads
- Clear error responses

#### Secret Management
- Fixed hardcoded API keys in tests
- All secrets from environment variables
- Test files use dummy values

#### Error Handling
- No internal error details exposed
- Generic error messages to users
- Detailed logging server-side only

## Testing

### Security Test Suite (`src/tests/security.test.ts`)
- URL validation tests
- Input sanitization tests
- Code validation tests
- Environment handling tests

### API Security Tests (`src/tests/api-security.test.ts`)
- Input validation endpoints
- Rate limiting verification
- Security header checks
- CORS protection tests
- Request size limit tests

## Migration Guide

### For Developers
1. Update local scripts:
   ```bash
   # Old
   npm run worker:evidence
   npm run worker:report
   
   # New
   npm run worker:evidence:active
   npm run worker:report:active
   ```

2. Use modern development commands:
   ```bash
   # Start everything (recommended)
   npm run start:all
   
   # Or start individually
   npm run dev:modern
   ```

3. Environment setup:
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
   - Fill in all required variables
   - Backend needs additional vars

### For Production
1. Update deployment scripts to use new worker commands
2. Ensure all environment variables are set
3. Configure ALLOWED_HOSTS for Python backend
4. Set NODE_ENV=production for enhanced security
5. Review rate limits for your traffic patterns

## Security Checklist

- [x] Rate limiting implemented on all APIs
- [x] Input validation for URLs and code
- [x] Security headers on all responses
- [x] CORS properly configured
- [x] Environment variables validated
- [x] No hardcoded secrets
- [x] Request size limits enforced
- [x] Error messages sanitized
- [x] Tests for security features

## Next Steps

1. **Monitor rate limits** in production and adjust as needed
2. **Add authentication** for sensitive endpoints
3. **Implement API keys** for external access
4. **Add request logging** for security auditing
5. **Set up security scanning** in CI/CD pipeline
6. **Regular dependency updates** for security patches

## Conclusion

The legacy code cleanup has simplified the architecture by removing confusing old workers and consolidating on the modern LangGraph v4 + Python backend stack. Basic security measures are now in place to protect against common attacks while maintaining developer productivity. The codebase is cleaner, more secure, and easier to understand for new developers.
