# TechScanIQ Architecture Analysis and Migration Plan

## Executive Summary

TechScanIQ has evolved from a simple web scanning tool to a complex AI-powered technology analysis platform. The current architecture shows signs of rapid growth with multiple architectural patterns coexisting (queue-based v1, LangGraph-based v2). This document provides a comprehensive analysis of the current state, proposes a target microservices architecture, and outlines a phased migration approach.

## Architecture Pain Points

### 1. Monolithic Worker Architecture

**Current State:**
- Workers run as separate Node.js processes via shell scripts
- No proper process management or auto-restart
- Each worker maintains its own memory state
- Resource inefficiency with duplicate initialization

**Impact:**
- Cannot scale horizontally
- Memory leaks accumulate over time
- Crashes require manual intervention
- Poor resource utilization

### 2. Queue System Limitations

**Current State:**
```typescript
// Multiple queue definitions without unified management
export const QUEUE_DEFINITIONS = {
  'evidence-collection': { concurrency: 3 },
  'report-generation': { concurrency: 2 },
  'unified-research': { concurrency: 2 },
  'deep-research': { concurrency: 1 },
  'langgraph-research': { concurrency: 2 }
}
```

**Impact:**
- Queue proliferation (10+ different queues)
- No proper workflow orchestration
- Fixed concurrency limits
- Difficult to monitor and manage

### 3. Tight Coupling

**Current State:**
- Workers directly access database
- Environment variables shared between frontend/backend
- No abstraction layers
- Direct external API calls from multiple places

**Impact:**
- Difficult to test in isolation
- Cannot swap implementations
- Security concerns with credential management
- Hard to add new integrations

### 4. Scalability Bottlenecks

**Current State:**
- In-memory state management
- Synchronous processing blocks event loop
- No connection pooling
- Linear workflow execution

**Impact:**
- Limited to single server capacity
- Long-running tasks block other processing
- Database connection exhaustion
- Cannot handle concurrent large scans

### 5. Security and Multi-tenancy Issues

**Current State:**
- Basic role-based access control
- No tenant isolation
- API keys in environment variables
- No key rotation mechanism

**Impact:**
- Not enterprise-ready
- Security audit failures
- Cannot support true multi-tenancy
- Compliance challenges

## Technical Decision Records

### ADR-001: Microservices vs Modular Monolith

**Status**: Accepted

**Context**: Need to decide between full microservices or modular monolith approach.

**Decision**: Adopt microservices architecture with phased migration.

**Rationale**:
- Current system already has natural service boundaries
- Need for independent scaling of AI workloads
- Multi-tenancy requirements favor isolation
- Team has experience with distributed systems

**Consequences**:
- Increased operational complexity
- Need for robust monitoring
- Higher initial development cost
- Better long-term scalability

### ADR-002: Event Bus Technology Selection

**Status**: Accepted

**Context**: Need to choose between Kafka, RabbitMQ, or AWS EventBridge.

**Decision**: Apache Kafka for event streaming.

**Rationale**:
- High throughput requirements
- Need for event replay capability
- Better suited for event sourcing
- Strong ecosystem and tooling

**Alternatives Considered**:
- RabbitMQ: Simpler but less scalable
- AWS EventBridge: Vendor lock-in concern
- Redis Streams: Limited features

### ADR-003: Container Orchestration Platform

**Status**: Accepted

**Context**: Choice between Kubernetes, ECS, or serverless.

**Decision**: Kubernetes for container orchestration.

**Rationale**:
- Platform agnostic
- Rich ecosystem
- Auto-scaling capabilities
- Strong community support

**Trade-offs**:
- Operational complexity
- Steep learning curve
- Need for dedicated ops expertise

### ADR-004: API Gateway Selection

**Status**: Proposed

**Context**: Need for API gateway for routing, auth, rate limiting.

**Options**:
1. Kong (Open Source)
   - Pros: Feature-rich, plugin ecosystem
   - Cons: Complex configuration

2. Tyk (Open Source)
   - Pros: GraphQL support, developer-friendly
   - Cons: Smaller community

3. AWS API Gateway
   - Pros: Managed service, integrated with AWS
   - Cons: Vendor lock-in, cost

**Recommendation**: Kong for flexibility and features.

### ADR-005: Multi-tenancy Strategy

**Status**: Accepted

**Context**: Need to support enterprise clients with isolation requirements.

**Decision**: Hybrid approach with shared infrastructure and logical isolation.

**Implementation**:
- Shared database with RLS
- Separate schemas for large tenants
- Isolated worker pools for enterprise
- Separate object storage per tenant

**Rationale**:
- Balance between isolation and efficiency
- Cost-effective for small tenants
- Flexibility for enterprise needs
