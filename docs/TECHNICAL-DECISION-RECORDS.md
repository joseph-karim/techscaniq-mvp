## ADR-001: Adopt Microservices Architecture

**Status**: Accepted

**Date**: 2024-01-15

**Context**: 
TechScanIQ has grown from a simple scanning tool to a complex platform with multiple AI integrations, worker processes, and increasing enterprise requirements. The current monolithic architecture is showing signs of strain:
- Cannot scale individual components independently
- Worker processes are resource-intensive and block each other
- Difficult to add new AI integrations without affecting existing functionality
- Multi-tenancy requirements demand better isolation
- Long deployment cycles affecting feature velocity

**Decision**: 
Adopt a microservices architecture with a phased migration approach using the strangler fig pattern.

**Rationale**:
- Natural service boundaries already exist in the codebase
- AI workloads need independent scaling
- Different components have different performance characteristics
- Team can work on services independently
- Enterprise clients require isolation guarantees
- Allows for technology diversity (Python for AI, Node.js for APIs)

**Consequences**: 
✅ Positive:
- Independent scaling of services
- Faster feature development
- Better fault isolation
- Technology flexibility
- Easier to onboard new team members

❌ Negative:
- Increased operational complexity
- Need for distributed systems expertise
- Higher infrastructure costs initially
- Complex debugging across services
- Need for robust monitoring

**Alternatives Considered**:
1. **Modular Monolith**: Keep single deployment but better internal boundaries
   - Rejected: Doesn't solve scaling issues
2. **Serverless**: Use Lambda/Functions for workers
   - Rejected: Cold starts problematic for AI workloads
3. **Kubernetes Jobs**: Use K8s jobs for workers
   - Considered: Will use for batch processing in microservices
