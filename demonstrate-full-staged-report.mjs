      content: `## Executive Summary

Snowplow presents a compelling buy-and-scale opportunity in the high-growth CDP market, with strong technical foundations but limited public financial data. Based on 35 evidence items analyzed across technical, market, and organizational dimensions.

### Investment Thesis Alignment
**Buy-and-Scale Score: 72/100** (Moderate-High confidence)

The company demonstrates solid technical scalability with cloud-native architecture and established enterprise customer base. Key strengths include proprietary data collection technology and strong partner ecosystem. Primary concerns center on limited visibility into financial metrics and competitive differentiation beyond data quality.

### Key Findings
✓ **Technical**: Scalable cloud architecture on AWS with real-time processing
✓ **Market**: Growing CDP market (25% CAGR) with enterprise customer focus  
✓ **Risks**: Limited financial transparency, strong competition from Segment

### Recommendation
**PROCEED WITH DEEPER DILIGENCE** - Focus on obtaining:
1. Financial metrics (ARR, growth rate, burn rate)
2. Technical architecture documentation
3. Customer concentration analysis
4. Competitive win/loss data

### Critical Next Steps
- Schedule management presentation within 2 weeks
- Engage technical DD firm for architecture review
- Conduct 10+ customer reference calls
- Obtain 3-year financial projections`,
