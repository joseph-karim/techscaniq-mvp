# PE-Grade Technical Due Diligence Test: Mixpanel

## 🎯 Executive Summary

This test simulates a **real $500M-1B growth equity investment** technical due diligence on Mixpanel. The analysis focuses on whether Mixpanel's technology can support 20-40% ARR growth through platform scalability, development velocity, and market expansion readiness.

## 🚀 Quick Start (Without All APIs)

```bash
# 1. Install basic dependencies
npm install bullmq ioredis cheerio

# 2. Start Redis (if not running)
docker run -d -p 6379:6379 --name redis redis:7-alpine

# 3. Start the deep evidence worker
npm run worker:evidence:deep

# 4. In another terminal, run the test
npm run test:mixpanel
```

## 🔧 Full Setup (With All Features)

```bash
# Run the setup script
chmod +x scripts/setup-deep-scan.sh
./scripts/setup-deep-scan.sh

# This will:
# - Install all dependencies (crawl4ai, openai)
# - Check/start Redis
# - Pull Docker images for security scanning
# - Verify environment variables
```

### Required Environment Variables

Add to `.env`:
```env
# Required
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-url
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key

# Optional (for custom search)
GOOGLE_CSE_ID=...      # Google Custom Search Engine ID
```

### API Keys (Stored in Supabase Vault)

The worker automatically fetches these from Supabase vault:
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` - Claude for intelligent analysis
- `GOOGLE_API_KEY` - Gemini Flash for parsing + search

No need to add these to `.env` - they're securely stored in Supabase!

## 📊 What the Test Does

### Phase 1: Deep Website Crawling (10-15 min)
- Crawls 50-200 pages of mixpanel.com
- Extracts HTML, code snippets, API documentation
- Identifies technology stack and architecture patterns
- Scores evidence based on "accelerate-organic-growth" thesis

### Phase 2: Network & Security Analysis (5-10 min)
- SSL/TLS security assessment
- Performance metrics (if Lighthouse installed)
- Vulnerability scanning (if Nuclei installed)
- API endpoint discovery

### Phase 3: Intelligent Search (5-10 min)
- Searches for revenue indicators
- Finds team/leadership information
- Discovers customer case studies
- Locates technical blog posts

### Phase 4: Agentic Deep Dive (10-15 min)
- AI analyzes gaps in evidence
- Makes decisions on what to investigate next
- Performs targeted searches and crawls
- Continues until 200+ evidence items collected

## 🎯 Expected Results

### Evidence Volume
- **Target**: 200+ total evidence items
- **High-confidence items**: 50+ (score ≥ 0.85)
- **Code analysis**: 10+ pages with code samples
- **Technology signals**: 30+ identified technologies

### Key Questions Answered
1. ✅ **Scalability**: Can handle 10x traffic growth?
2. ✅ **Dev Velocity**: CI/CD pipeline maturity?
3. ✅ **API Coverage**: Integration capabilities?
4. ✅ **Cloud Costs**: Infrastructure efficiency?
5. ✅ **Security**: SOC2, GDPR compliance?

### Investment Thesis Alignment
For "Accelerate Organic Growth" thesis:
- Cloud architecture scalability (30% weight)
- Development velocity & pipeline (25% weight)
- Market expansion readiness (25% weight)
- Code quality & technical debt (20% weight)

## 📈 Interpreting Results

### Strong Buy Indicators
- 200+ evidence items collected
- Cloud-native architecture confirmed
- Strong API documentation found
- Modern tech stack (React, Node.js, etc.)
- Security certifications mentioned
- CI/CD pipeline evidence

### Red Flags
- <150 evidence items (limited transparency)
- Legacy technology detected
- No API documentation found
- Security gaps identified
- Poor performance metrics
- Limited scalability indicators

## 🔍 Sample Output

```
📊 Evidence Summary:
Total items: 247

By Type:
  - technical_architecture: 45
  - api_documentation: 32
  - technology_stack: 28
  - company_overview: 25
  - security_analysis: 22
  - code_analysis: 18
  - product_information: 15
  - ...

High Confidence Items (≥0.85): 67

🔧 Technology Stack Discovered:
React, Node.js, PostgreSQL, Redis, Kubernetes, AWS, Docker, 
GraphQL, TypeScript, Webpack, Jest, CircleCI...

💰 Investment Thesis Alignment:
✅ Investment Opportunities:
  • Cloud-native architecture supports scaling
  • Container infrastructure enables rapid deployment
  • Strong API architecture facilitates integrations

⚠️ Investment Risks:
  • Limited test coverage may slow feature velocity
  • Missing API documentation complicates acquisitions

🏆 PE Diligence Summary:
✅ STRONG EVIDENCE BASE for investment decision
   - Comprehensive technical architecture understanding
   - Clear API integration capabilities
   - Security posture assessed
   - Ready for deeper financial/commercial diligence
```

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### "No evidence collection workers detected"
Start the worker first: `npm run worker:evidence:deep`

### "Redis not running"
Start Redis: `docker run -d -p 6379:6379 redis:7-alpine`

### "Cannot find module 'crawl4ai'"
The worker will fall back to basic crawling. For full features: `npm install crawl4ai`

### Low evidence count (<100)
- Check if the domain is accessible
- Verify Redis is running
- Look at worker logs for errors
- May need to increase timeout/depth settings

## 💼 Real PE Usage

In actual PE diligence, this would be:
1. **Week 1**: Technical architecture assessment (this tool)
2. **Week 2**: Financial model deep dive
3. **Week 3**: Customer reference calls
4. **Week 4**: Management presentations
5. **Week 5**: Final Investment Committee

This tool automates Week 1's technical assessment that typically costs $50-100k from consulting firms.

## 📞 Next Steps

After successful test:
1. Generate comprehensive investment report
2. Review high-risk findings in detail
3. Schedule technical deep dives on specific concerns
4. Prepare questions for management team
5. Compare against other portfolio companies
