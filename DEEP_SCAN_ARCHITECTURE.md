# Deep Evidence Collection Architecture

## üèóÔ∏è System Design

### API Strategy
- **Google Gemini Flash**: High-volume content parsing & extraction (fast & cheap)
- **Claude (Anthropic)**: Strategic decisions & investment analysis (smart & precise)  
- **Google Search API**: Web searches for additional evidence
- **Direct API calls**: No edge functions, direct from worker

### Security
- API keys stored in **Supabase Vault** (not in .env)
- Service role key provides vault access
- Keys loaded once on worker startup

### Evidence Collection Flow

```
1. Deep Crawl (crawl4ai)
   ‚Üì
2. Parse with Gemini Flash (extract tech stack, team, etc.)
   ‚Üì
3. Analyze gaps with Claude (what's missing?)
   ‚Üì
4. Search for missing evidence (Google Search)
   ‚Üì
5. Score by investment thesis alignment
   ‚Üì
6. Store in Supabase (200+ evidence items)
```

### Investment Thesis Alignment

Evidence is weighted based on PE thesis:
- **Accelerate Growth**: Cloud scalability (30%), Dev velocity (25%)
- **Buy & Build**: API architecture (25%), Multi-tenant ready (25%)
- **Margin Expansion**: Cloud costs (30%), Automation potential (25%)
- **Turnaround**: Security gaps (35%), Tech debt (20%)

### Performance

- Crawls 50-200 pages in 15-20 minutes
- Extracts 10-20 evidence items per page
- Total: 200-300 evidence items per scan
- Cost: ~$0.50-1.00 per full scan

### Worker Architecture

```typescript
// Simplified flow
async function collectEvidence() {
  // 1. Load API keys from vault
  const keys = await loadFromSupabaseVault()
  
  // 2. Deep crawl website
  const pages = await crawl4ai.deepCrawl(domain)
  
  // 3. Parse each page with Gemini
  for (const page of pages) {
    const extracted = await geminiFlash.parse(page.html)
    const evidence = scoreByThesis(extracted, investmentThesis)
    await store(evidence)
  }
  
  // 4. Analyze with Claude
  const decision = await claude.analyze(currentEvidence, gaps)
  
  // 5. Fill gaps with search
  if (decision.needsMoreEvidence) {
    const results = await googleSearch(decision.query)
    await processSearchResults(results)
  }
}
```

## üöÄ Running the System

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start worker
npm run worker:evidence:deep

# Terminal 2: Run Mixpanel test
npm run test:mixpanel
```

## üí∞ Cost Efficiency

Per scan costs:
- Gemini Flash: ~$0.30 (parsing 200 pages)
- Claude Haiku: ~$0.10 (10-15 decisions)
- Google Search: ~$0.10 (10 searches)
- **Total: ~$0.50 per company**

Compare to:
- Manual PE diligence: $50-100k
- Consulting firm: $25-50k
- This system: $0.50 + infrastructure

## üéØ PE-Grade Output

The system answers:
1. Can the platform scale 10x? (architecture evidence)
2. How fast can they ship features? (CI/CD evidence)
3. What's the cloud cost structure? (infrastructure evidence)
4. Is the codebase maintainable? (code quality evidence)
5. What security risks exist? (compliance evidence)
