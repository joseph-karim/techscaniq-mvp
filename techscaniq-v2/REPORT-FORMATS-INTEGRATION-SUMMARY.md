// Sales Intelligence Report
const salesReport = await runFormatAwareResearch(thesis, {
  reportType: 'sales-intelligence',
  maxIterations: 2,
  useSonar: true,
  useMarketContext: true,
});

// PE Due Diligence Report
const peReport = await runFormatAwareResearch(thesis, {
  reportType: 'pe-due-diligence',

  useSonar: true,
  useMarketContext: true,
});
```

## Integration with Existing Features

1. **Market Context Awareness**
