   - Structured prompts following meta-prompt pattern

2. **Pipeline Implementation**
   - Thesis interpretation with NLP analysis
   - Dynamic query generation
   - Evidence gathering with proper content extraction
   - Quality evaluation and scoring
   - Reflection and iterative refinement
   - Report generation with citations

3. **Tool Integration**
   - crawl4ai integration with BestFirst strategy
   - Skyvern integration for interactive discovery
   - Web search capabilities
   - Document analysis (HTML, PDF)
   - API discovery
   - Technical profile collection

4. **Data Layer**
   - Supabase vector store integration
   - Semantic search implementation
   - Evidence storage with metadata

## üöß Remaining Work

### 1. Background Task Queue (Priority: High)
- [ ] Set up Redis connection for BullMQ
- [ ] Implement queue workers for:
  - Web search jobs
  - Document analysis jobs
  - Quality evaluation jobs
- [ ] Add job monitoring and error handling
- [ ] Implement rate limiting and retries

### 2. Database Migration (Priority: High)
- [ ] Apply vector store migration to Supabase
- [ ] Create indexes for performance
- [ ] Set up RLS policies for security
- [ ] Test vector similarity search

### 3. API Endpoints (Priority: Medium)
- [ ] Complete Fastify API implementation
- [ ] Add authentication middleware
- [ ] Implement endpoints:
  - POST /api/research/start
  - GET /api/research/:id/status
  - GET /api/research/:id/report
  - POST /api/evidence/search
- [ ] Add OpenAPI documentation
- [ ] Implement rate limiting

### 4. Frontend Dashboard (Priority: Medium)
- [ ] Create Next.js frontend application
- [ ] Implement pages:
  - Research submission form
  - Real-time progress monitoring
  - Report viewer with citations
  - Evidence explorer
- [ ] Add visualization for:
  - Investment thesis pillars
  - Evidence quality scores
  - Research progress

### 5. Testing & Quality (Priority: High)
- [ ] Add unit tests for all nodes
- [ ] Integration tests for orchestrator
- [ ] End-to-end test scenarios
- [ ] Performance benchmarking
- [ ] Load testing for concurrent research

### 6. Production Readiness (Priority: High)
- [ ] Environment configuration management
- [ ] Logging and monitoring setup
- [ ] Error tracking (Sentry integration)
- [ ] Deployment scripts
- [ ] Docker containerization
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline

### 7. Advanced Features (Priority: Low)
- [ ] Webhook notifications for research completion
- [ ] Export formats (PDF, DOCX, Markdown)
- [ ] Research collaboration features
- [ ] Historical research comparison
- [ ] Custom pillar configuration
- [ ] Multi-language support

## üîß Technical Debt
1. Replace `require('pdf-parse')` with proper ES module import
2. Remove `as any` type assertions in graph.ts
3. Add proper error types instead of generic Error
4. Implement connection pooling for database
5. Add request/response validation middleware

## üìä Performance Optimizations
1. Implement caching layer for:
   - API responses
   - LLM completions
   - Search results
2. Optimize vector search queries
3. Implement parallel evidence gathering
4. Add result deduplication at database level

## üîí Security Enhancements
1. API key rotation mechanism
2. Request signing for webhooks
3. Data encryption at rest
4. Audit logging for all operations
5. Rate limiting per user/API key

## üìù Documentation Needs
1. API documentation with examples
2. Deployment guide
3. Configuration reference
4. Troubleshooting guide
5. Contributing guidelines

## Quick Start for Next Steps

### 1. Apply Database Migration
```bash
cd techscaniq-v2
npm run migrate
```

### 2. Start Redis (for BullMQ)
```bash
redis-server
```

### 3. Start the API Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 4. Run Tests
```bash
npm test
```

## Estimated Timeline
- Week 1: Background queue + Database migration
- Week 2: API endpoints + Basic frontend
- Week 3: Testing + Production readiness
- Week 4: Deployment + Documentation

## Notes
- The core orchestration engine is complete and functional
- Evidence collection now properly extracts content (fixing the main issue)
- All TypeScript errors have been resolved
- The system is ready for integration with background workers and API layer
